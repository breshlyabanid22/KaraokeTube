# KaraokeTube

KaraokeTube is a modern web application that brings the classic karaoke experience online using YouTube videos. With KaraokeTube, you can search for karaoke tracks via the YouTube API v3, create or join a session (lobby), and collaboratively build a queue of songs to sing along with friendsâ€”just like a real karaoke night, but powered by YouTube.
